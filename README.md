# CapyData_Sport Action Image Captioning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an image captioning model for sports-related images. The goal is to generate accurate and descriptive captions for various sports events, athletes, and key moments using deep learning techniques. All captions are written in Vietnamese.

## Objectives
1. Collect and curate a dataset of sports images.
2. Preprocess and annotate the dataset with descriptive captions in Vietnamese.
3. Develop an image captioning model using deep learning.
4. Evaluate model performance and improve caption quality.
5. Deploy the model for real-world applications in sports analytics and media.

## Data Collection and Annotation
- Source: Images were automatically crawled from Pinterest using the keyword format: "sport + 'action in real life'."
- Annotation Process: Captions were generated using OpenAI API and later reviewed and refined by native Vietnamese speakers with sports expertise.

## Getting Started
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sports-captioning.git
cd sports-captioning
```

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
conda create -n captioning-env python=3.9 -y
conda activate captioning-env
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the notebooks:
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to view and run model training and evaluation steps.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Data Quality Metrics:
    - Caption length distribution
    - Vocabulary diversity
    - Word frequency analysis
    - Image quality checks
- Model Performance Metrics:
    - BLEU, ROUGE (n-gram-based)
    - BERTScore (semantic similarity)
    - Distinct-n (caption diversity)
    - Human Evaluation

## Modeling Approaches

Four different approaches were considered for training the model:

1. Traditional Pipeline:
- CNN + LSTM (Show and Tell model)

2. Attention-Based Pipeline:
- CNN + LSTM + Attention (Show, Attend and Tell)

3. Transformer-Based Pipeline:
- CNN/ViT + Transformer (e.g., BART, T5)

4. Modern Pretrained Models:
- Encoder: CLIP, Oscar, ViT
- Decoder: GPT/Vision-Language Transformers
- Fine-tuning models like BLIP-2 or multimodal architectures
